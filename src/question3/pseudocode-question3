Using method overloading create max (maximum) and min (minimum) methods that accept either 3 integers, 3 doubles or 3 characters.

Method overloading is when there are multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different signatures and parameters.

1. Create multiple overloaded methods which are min and max methods

2. The overloaded methods should be able to receive parameters of int, double and character.

3. In the methods, the maximum and minimum of the values passed into it would be found.
