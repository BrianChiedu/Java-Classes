2.	Write a function that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
•	N is an integer within the range [1..100,000].
•	each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].


Requirements

1. Function should have an array with N integers
2. Function should return the smallest positive integer not in the array
3. Index of the array should be 1<= x <=100,000
4. Actual elements of the array should be -1,000,000 <= y <=1,000,000
