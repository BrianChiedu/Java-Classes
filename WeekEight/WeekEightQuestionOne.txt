Question 1

1.	Write a function that accepts a 2D char array and two chars. The purpose of the function is to replace every occurrence of the first char with the second char.
The function should also return how many letters were replaced
Test it in the main method. For example, create an array with these characters:
	G, B, A, C, A, B
	K, D, X, F, O, B
	Z, H, S, A, D, C
Use the function to replace all occurrences of B with H and get 
	G, H, A, C, A, H
	K, D, X, F, O, H
	Z, H, S, A, D, C
The function should return 3.
Write a function that prints a 2D char array. Use it in the main method to print the array before and after modification.
